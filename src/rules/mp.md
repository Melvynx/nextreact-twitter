# Private messages rules

- Respect the other person's privacy: Private messages are just that - private. Be mindful of what you share in a DM and remember that it is not meant for public consumption.
- Use proper grammar and spelling: As with any form of written communication, it's important to use proper grammar and spelling in private messages.
- Be respectful: Treat others with kindness and respect in private messages, just as you would in any other form of communication.
- Keep it appropriate: Remember that private messages are not a place for inappropriate or offensive language or content.
- Don't spam: Sending repeated or unsolicited messages is considered spamming, and it is not allowed on Twitter.
- Follow the Twitter Rules: The rules that apply to tweets also apply to private messages, so be sure to familiarize yourself with them and follow them when sending DMs.
- Be mindful of the tone of your message: Keep in mind that written communication can sometimes be misinterpreted, so try to be clear and concise in your messaging and consider using emojis or other visual cues to convey tone.
- Respect the other person's boundaries: If the other person does not want to continue the conversation or has asked you to stop sending them messages, respect their wishes and do not continue to message them.
